    title: 'Spaghetti Bolognese',
    description: 'A classic Italian pasta dish with rich meat sauce.',
    ingredients: 'spaghetti, beef, tomato sauce',
    category: 'italian',
    instructions: "To make a delicious spaghetti Bolognese, start by heating two tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add a finely chopped large onion, one finely chopped carrot, and two finely chopped celery sticks. Sauté them until they soften, which should take about 5-7 minutes. Stir in three minced garlic cloves and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add 500 grams (about 1 pound) of ground beef to the pan, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook until browned all over. Once the meat is browned, pour in 1/2 cup of red wine and let it simmer until the liquid reduces slightly. Next, stir in a 400-gram (14-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes along with two tablespoons of tomato paste. Add a cup of beef stock, a teaspoon of dried oregano, a teaspoon of dried basil, and a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let the sauce simmer gently for at least 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer you let it simmer, the richer the flavor will be. While the sauce is simmering, cook 400 grams (14 ounces) of spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the pasta water. If the Bolognese sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it to your desired consistency. Serve the spaghetti on plates, topped generously with the Bolognese sauce. Finish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of chopped fresh basil or parsley for added freshness. Enjoy your hearty, flavorful spaghetti Bolognese!",

    ingredients: 'chicken, coconut milk, curry paste',
    category: 'indian',
    instructions: "To make a flavorful chicken curry, start by heating two tablespoons of oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add two finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Stir in four minced garlic cloves and a one-inch piece of minced ginger, cooking until fragrant. Add your spices: one teaspoon each of turmeric, cumin, coriander, chili powder (adjust to taste), and garam masala. Cook the spices for about a minute to release their aromas. Add one kilogram (2.2 lbs) of chicken pieces (boneless or bone-in) and stir well to coat them in the spices. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside. Add two chopped tomatoes (or one cup of canned tomatoes) and cook until they break down and blend with the spices. Stir in half a cup of plain yogurt for extra richness, then pour in one cup of water or chicken broth to create a sauce. Season with salt to taste, bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook for 20–25 minutes until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. Uncover and simmer for a few more minutes if you'd like to thicken the curry. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with steamed rice or warm naan. Enjoy your delicious and aromatic chicken curry!",
